# SimpleRenderer
What I intend to be a simple 2D-Rendering-Engine to test various algorithms.

Since I both want to improve on the whole .NET-Universe (not least because developing .NET-based application is probably going to be my job for the rest of my study course) and on computer graphics principles and algorithms, I decided to create a small engine that aims to be able to render simple 2D-Geometry and perform some simple algorithms in the planar space.

This engine is not intended to be efficient at all and uses WPF-Elements to render individual "pixels" (which don't correspond with the actual pixels on our device, but are larger boxes for presentation purposes).
